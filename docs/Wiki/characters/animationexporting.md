# Animation Exporting

Using GE you can export animations in the .bin and .fbx formats.

BIN animations are in the game's internal format.

FBX animations are in a format that can be edited in most 3D animation software. Note that GE exports in a proprietary FBX format that needs to be converted before being compatible with most 3D software. To convert the models, use [Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91).(1)

1. Blender 4.5's "experimental" FBX importer (now the default importer as of Blender 5.0) can import FBX models from GE without the use of Noesis.
