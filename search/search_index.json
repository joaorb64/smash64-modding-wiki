For Brian, I do not have any extra dynamic textures, as I only swap his face texture. </p> <p>For completion sake, I am listing the steps for adding a new dynamic texture hypothetically. If we were to add a new dynamic texture, we need to modify the bone in the character file, adding in the bone and the pointers. </p> <p>Looking at the Head texture location from before, we see that 0E0000 is your face dynamic texture inherited by Mario. </p> <p>0E - model part  00 - number of iterations through the texture hierarchy  00 - not sure but seems to match second byte </p> <p>If we want another Dynamic face texture, we would insert 0E0101 to the file. Adding multiple dynamic textures would increase the two trailing bytes, i.e. 0E0202, 0E0303, etc. After adding in the new dynamic textures, pad the word til it is 0x4 bytes total.</p> <p>| 0E00 0000                  | 0E00000E 01010000           | | 0E00000E 01010000          | 0E00000E 01010E02 02000000  | | 0E00000E 01010E02 02000000 | 0E00000E 01010E02 020E0303  |</p> <p>Inserting one new dynamic texture would look something like this.</p> <p>Notice how all the values after the inserted words have now changed. This means the pointers in the entire file have moved. This needs to be fixed. There is a provided pointerfix script created by Fray that will update all the pointers in your file. Save the character.bin and run the bass program. You have to provide the following in the script.</p> <p>filename - just the name of the file, not including extension offset - offset within the file where you are inserting new data shift - size of the insertion (probably needs to be in increments of 0x4)  internal_offset - \"Internal File Table Offset\" in the editor's game configuration window  external_offset - \"Internal File Resource Offset\" in the editor's game configuration window </p> <p>Get the internal offsets from game configuration</p> <p>the command would look like this: fix_pointers(brianmain, 0x198, 0x4, 0x114, 0x0)</p> <p>If we were to add in multiple dynamic textures, 0x4 would change from 0x4 to 0x8, or 0x12 depending on how many were added.</p> <p>If you want a dynamic texture on a bone other then the head, add it to the character file in the same location, and run the pointer fix application.</p> <p>i.e. 0E000015 00000000</p>"},{"location":"Wiki/characters/characterRigModification/#step-6-hex-editing-the-character-file-to-fix-unknown-value-data","title":"Step 6) Hex editing the character file to fix Unknown Value Data","text":"<p>This next section has to do with fixing joints associated with damage types, fixing the shield pose and other rig problems.
